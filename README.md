# C and C++ School Projects

This repository contains several C and C++ projects developed as part of my coursework in systems programming and compiler construction. Each project focuses on a key area of low-level software development, including memory management, operating systems, and compiler design.

## About the Projects

The purpose of these C/C++ projects was to gain practical experience with systems-level programming and core computer science concepts, including:

- Building a custom **memory manager** to handle dynamic allocation and deallocation, simulating malloc/free behavior
- Implementing components of an **operating system**, such as process scheduling, system calls, and interrupt handling
- Developing a basic **compiler** capable of lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation for a simple programming language
- Applying low-level programming techniques and managing system resources efficiently
- Reinforcing theoretical knowledge with hands-on development in C and C++ environments

Each project corresponds to a major topic covered in the coursework, providing a deep understanding of how systems work under the hood through real-world simulations and programming challenges.
