# MiniJava Compiler â€“ School Project

This project is a **MiniJava compiler** built for educational purposes. It covers all major phases of a compiler, including:

- Lexical Analysis (via **Flex**)
- Syntax Analysis (via **Bison**)
- Semantic Analysis (Symbol Table, Type Checking)
- Intermediate Code Generation (Three-Address Code - TAC)
- Bytecode Interpretation (Virtual Machine-style execution)
