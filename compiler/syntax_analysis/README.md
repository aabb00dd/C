# Syntax Analysis for MiniJava (Bison Parser)

This project implements a **syntax analyzer (parser)** for a MiniJava-like language using **GNU Bison**. It builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) based on a specified grammar and integrates with a custom `Node` structure to represent each parsed construct.

---

## Overview

This parser uses **LALR(1)** parsing strategy and is designed to:

- Parse MiniJava-like programs.
- Handle variable declarations, control structures, methods, and expressions.
- Generate a parse tree using custom `Node` objects.
- Cooperate with a Flex-based lexer.
- Support verbose error messages with line number tracking.

---

## Integration with Lexer

The parser expects tokens generated by a Flex lexer (`lexer.l`) using Bison's C++ interface.

- Tokens such as `CLASS`, `IF`, `INT`, `STRING_LITERAL`, `PLUSOP`, etc., are passed with `std::string` as values.
- `yylineno` is used for line number tracking.
- Shared `Node* root` is built during parsing.
